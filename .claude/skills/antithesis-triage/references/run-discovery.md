# Run Discovery

## How to obtain a list of runs on the tenant

```sh
snouty runs --json list -n 200 [OPTIONS]
```

Use `-n 200` as the default page size. Snouty's built-in default page size is too small for triage — it can miss the run when matching a triage-report URL (rule 3) or when looking for the oldest non-triaged run (rule 4). Bump higher (e.g. `-n 500` or `-n 1000`) if a search at 200 still doesn't find what the user is asking for.

You may use `snouty runs list --help` to see the other OPTIONS. The `--status` option is useful if you know the status. `snouty runs list` returns runs with one of the following statuses: `starting`, `in_progress`, `completed`, `cancelled`, `incomplete`, `unknown`. The status `incomplete` usually means the run failed to start for some reason and the failure can be triaged. To determine whether ANY run is triageable, check `links.triage_report` in the run's JSON: if a report URL is present, a report was generated and you can proceed with triage. If `links` is null or `triage_report` is absent, no report exists.

## How to tell what run_id the user wants to use

Apply these rules, in order.

1. The user may provide a run id directly -- if so, use that. Here is an example run_id:

```
2c6fa5b630e543a92c98fbed4b555280-53-1
```

2. The user may ask for "the latest run" or "the run where we were trying
   <xxx>". Consult `snouty runs` if this is not in your context. You can also
   consider the description of the runs returned in the run list to identify a
   run the user is asking for. Take into account the webhooks and sources you
   have been using with this user. See the notes below.

3. If the user provides a triage report URL, look up the run_id by matching
   the URL against `links.triage_report` in the runs list.

   A report URL looks like:

   ```
   https://<TENANT_ID>.antithesis.com/report/***/***.html?auth=<AUTH_TOKEN>
   ```

   You should verify the `TENANT_ID` matches snouty's resolved tenant (shown by `snouty doctor --json`; see the skill's Preflight) before proceeding. If it does not match, then `snouty` will not be able to find the run.

   Everything before the `?auth=` query string is stable per run. Thus, use this pattern to find the run id for a provided URL:

   ```bash
   URL='<paste full URL from user>'
   snouty runs --json list -n 200 \
     | jq -r --arg url "$URL" \
         'select(.links.triage_report // "" | startswith($url | split("?")[0])) | .run_id'
   ```

   The output is the `run_id`. If the command prints nothing, the run is
   older than the last 200 runs — retry with `-n 500` or `-n 1000`. If it
   still does not match, the report URL is for a different tenant or the
   run is no longer listed; ask the user to supply the run_id directly (the
   run_id is in the bottom section of the Triage Report).

4. If the user did not provide an explicit triage report or run id, use the oldest non-triaged run, if you know whether runs were triaged or not. If you do not know which runs have been triaged, use the most recently completed run.

### Notes

- When trying to intuit a run_id from the runs list, take into account the webhook and the source the user is using. Filter on these fields. If the user is using a non-default webhook or source this should be in your memory. For example, if you know your user is using a webhook "my_special_webhook", consider only runs in the runs list that use that webhook. This is because sometimes tenants are shared by different projects within the same customer. Of course if the user asks you to go beyond just the one webhook or source, do that.

- Make sure NOT to filter by text or status unless explicitly asked. If you are trying to find the most recent run for a project, just look at recent runs with any status first. Only filter by text or status if you can't find what you are looking for.
