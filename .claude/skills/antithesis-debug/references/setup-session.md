# Setup & Session

## Launching an MVD session

Before opening a debugger URL, you may need to launch the session first. If the
user already gave you a debugging-session URL, skip this section. Launching
requires `snouty`:

- DO NOT PROCEED if `snouty` is not installed. See
  `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antithesishq/snouty/refs/heads/main/README.md`
  for installation options.
- DO NOT PROCEED if `snouty` is not at least version 0.6.0. Use `snouty
--version` to find the version. Use `snouty update` to update.

`snouty debug` is the launch command. Identify the target run with exactly
one of `--run-id` (preferred) or `--session-id`, and pin the moment to debug
with `--input-hash` and `--vtime`:

```bash
snouty debug \
  --run-id "$RUN_ID" \
  --input-hash "$INPUT_HASH" \
  --vtime "$VTIME" \
  --description "$DESCRIPTION" \
  --recipients "$EMAIL"
```

`--description` is optional, but always pass one and make it **unique and
findable later** (e.g., include the property name, a date stamp, or a ticket
id) — you'll use this string to locate the session in the list of debugging
sessions when you (or a teammate) come back to it. `--recipients` is an
optional semicolon-delimited list of emails to notify.

### Getting the input hash and vtime

`--input-hash` and `--vtime` pin the single moment to debug. Extract the input hash and vtime from context and pass them as flags. (`--input-hash` is often negative; keep the leading `-`.)

Infer which moment to use based on the user's prompt. The user may ask you to get a moment from a few different sources:

- A `Moment.from({ ... })` blob from the report's _copy moment_ button, a
  copied log line, or some free-form message — read the `input_hash` and `vtime`
  out of it yourself.
- **The API.** Moments come back from `snouty runs show $RUN_ID` (the failure
  moment of an incomplete run), `snouty runs properties $RUN_ID --detail`
  (example / counterexample moments per property), and the `moment` attached
  to every entry from `snouty runs logs` and `snouty runs events`.
- **An instruction to go find one.** If the user says something like "debug the
  failing `Counter` property" or "start a debugging session at an event
  containing the error message XYZ," use the API sources above to resolve the
  concrete input hash and vtime first.

If you can't pin down both an input hash and a vtime from a clear source, ask
the user rather than guessing.

Snouty returns the debugging-session URL on success; proceed to "Opening a
debugger URL" below.

## Session naming

Use a fresh, unique browser session for each debugging run so concurrent agents
do not collide:

```
SESSION="antithesis-debug-$(date +%s)-$$"
```

Always pair with `--session-name antithesis` so `agent-browser` manages shared
authentication state automatically.

Replace `$SESSION` in all commands below.

## Opening a debugger URL

Open the provided URL:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" --session-name antithesis open "$URL"
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" wait --load networkidle
```

Then verify auth deterministically by checking the URL the browser landed on:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" get url
```

If the URL still starts with `https://$TENANT.antithesis.com/...` you are
authenticated and can proceed. If it redirected to `accounts.google.com`
(or any other login domain), authentication is needed — defer to the
`antithesis-agent-browser` skill's `references/setup-auth.md` for the
interactive login flow. Use the same `--session-name antithesis` so auth
state is shared.

> **The `?auth=v2.public...` token in a debugger URL is NOT a session
> token.** It scopes access to a specific report; a session cookie from a
> full login is still required. Even a fresh PASETO token in the URL
> won't bypass the SSO redirect on first contact. Plan to run the
> interactive login flow once per `--session-name`.

> **Auth domain note:** the `antithesis-agent-browser` `setup-auth.md`
> directs the user to `https://antithesis.com/login/?redirect=home`. That
> establishes auth at the central domain; for tenant subdomains
> (`$TENANT.antithesis.com`) the cookies propagate in the same browser
> session-name, so after login you can re-open the tenant URL headless.

## Injecting the runtime

After the page loads, inject the debugger runtime. This is required for **both**
simplified and advanced modes:

```bash
cat assets/antithesis-debug.js \
  | agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval --stdin
```

This registers methods on `window.__antithesisDebug` with three namespaces:
`simplified`, `notebook`, and `actions`.

If `window.__antithesisDebug` is missing after a navigation or page reload,
reinject `assets/antithesis-debug.js` and retry.

## Detecting and switching modes

The debugger usually opens in simplified mode, but some tenants may default to
advanced mode. After injecting the runtime, check which mode is active:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval \
  "window.__antithesisDebug.getMode()"
```

Returns `"simplified"` or `"advanced"`. To switch:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval \
  'window.__antithesisDebug.switchMode("simplified")'
```

## Waiting for readiness

For simplified mode:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval \
  "window.__antithesisDebug.simplified.waitForReady()"
```

For advanced mode (notebook):

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval \
  "window.__antithesisDebug.notebook.waitForReady()"
```

Both wait methods poll for up to 60 seconds and return a result object with
`ok`, `ready`, `attempts`, and `waitedMs`. On timeout, the result also includes
`details`.

## Snapshot for orientation

After the page is ready, take a snapshot for visual context:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" snapshot -i -C
```

## Cleanup

When debugging is complete, or if you abort after opening a browser session,
close it explicitly:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" close
```

Closing the live session is safe because the shared Antithesis authentication
state is managed separately by `--session-name antithesis`.
