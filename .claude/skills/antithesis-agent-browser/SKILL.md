# Antithesis agent-browser

**Skill version:** `2026-07-14 1f59c97`

A helper skill for reading data from authenticated Antithesis web pages
when the snouty API doesn't expose what's needed. Other skills
(`antithesis-triage`, `antithesis-debug`, `antithesis-query-logs`) delegate
here when they need an authenticated browser session.

## Purpose

- Handle interactive authentication to the user's Antithesis tenant with
  minimal disruption.
- Load Antithesis web pages (reports, logs, runs, causality) and extract
  data from them via an injected runtime.

## When to use

- When another skill needs information from an Antithesis page that snouty
  cannot reliably provide.
- When the user or another skill needs to interact with an Antithesis web
  page directly.

## Prerequisites

- DO NOT PROCEED if `agent-browser` is not installed. See `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vercel-labs/agent-browser/refs/heads/main/README.md` for installation options.
- DO NOT PROCEED if `agent-browser` is older than version `v0.23.4`. You can upgrade with `agent-browser upgrade`.
- DO NOT PROCEED if `jq` is not installed. See `https://jqlang.org/download/` for installation options.

**Reference files:** This skill's `references/` directory contains detailed guides for specific tasks. Do NOT read them all up front — only read a reference file when you are told to. Each reference file is mentioned by name at the point where it is needed.

## General guidance

- **Always ensure you are authenticated first.**
- **Use disposable sessions.** Generate a unique `SESSION` for each invocation of this skill.
- **Inject the runtime after navigation.** After every `open`, after link clicks that may change pages, and after reopening a report from a finding route, wait until `networkidle`, inject `assets/antithesis-agent-browser.js`, then use the matching `*.waitForReady()` method before continuing.
- **Never run `agent-browser` calls in parallel.** They are stateful with side effects.
- **Retry missing-runtime errors by reinjecting.** If a command fails because `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser` is undefined or missing, inject the runtime and rerun the same method.
- **Keep report evals on the main report view.** If you click into another page by accident, reopen the original report URL before using report queries again.

## Session management with `agent-browser`

`agent-browser` has two session variables:

- `--session`: the name of a unique, isolated browser instance
- `--session-name`: auto-save/restore cookies by name

Every invocation MUST use a unique `--session` value. Generate it once and reuse it whenever you see `$SESSION` referenced by this skill.

```sh
SESSION=`antithesis-ab-$(date +%s)-$$`
```

Use `--session-name antithesis` on the FIRST `agent-browser` command that references a new `$SESSION`. This creates the session and restores saved cookies. Subsequent commands for the same `$SESSION` do not need `--session-name` — the session already exists.

Close the live session when done.

```sh
agent-browser --session $SESSION close
```

## Authentication

Do NOT navigate to the home page just to check auth. Instead, navigate directly to your target URL (report, runs page, etc.) using the session-creation command:

```
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" --session-name antithesis open "$TARGET_URL"
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" wait --load networkidle
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" get url
```

If the URL starts with `https://$TENANT.antithesis.com` then you are authenticated. If it redirected to a login page, you need to authenticate — read `references/setup-auth.md`, which gates the interactive headed login on user confirmation.

## Runtime injection

This skill ships a runtime (`assets/antithesis-agent-browser.js`) that exposes helper methods on `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser` for reading data from Antithesis pages. Inject it after navigation completes:

```bash
cat assets/antithesis-agent-browser.js \
  | agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval --stdin
```

Call its methods with `agent-browser eval`:

```bash
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval \
  "window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.report.getRunMetadata()"
```

`agent-browser eval` awaits Promises automatically, so async and sync methods use the same call pattern.

**Error handling:** Runtime methods throw on error, which causes `agent-browser eval` to return a non-zero exit code. Check the exit code to detect failures — no output parsing required. The error message describes what went wrong (e.g. wrong page, element not found, timeout).

If `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser` is missing, reinject `assets/antithesis-agent-browser.js` and retry.

NEVER run `agent-browser` calls in parallel. They are stateful calls with side effects; parallel calls can break or return confusing results.

## Navigation and loading

Each Antithesis page loads content asynchronously. After navigation to any Antithesis page, follow this pattern:

First, wait for networkidle:

```sh
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" wait --load networkidle
```

Then, check the url to see if you got redirected to an authentication page:

```sh
agent-browser --session "$SESSION" get url
```

If you hit an authentication page, stop and reauthenticate before continuing.

Then, inject the runtime:

```bash
cat assets/antithesis-agent-browser.js \
  | agent-browser --session "$SESSION" eval --stdin
```

Finally, eval the page-specific wait function to wait for all asynchronous chunks to finish loading:

- Report page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.report.waitForReady()`
- Logs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.logs.waitForReady()`
- Runs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.runs.waitForReady()`

Each wait method polls for up to 60 seconds by default. On success it returns `{ attempts, waitedMs }`. On timeout, the method **throws** causing `agent-browser eval` to return a non-zero exit code.

Use the lower-level boolean checks when you need a one-shot probe:

- Report page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.report.loadingFinished()`
- Logs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.logs.loadingFinished()`
- Runs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.runs.loadingFinished()`

If a page still does not become ready, inspect status:

- Report page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.report.loadingStatus()`
- Logs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.logs.loadingStatus()`
- Runs page: `window.__antithesisAgentBrowser.runs.loadingStatus()`

## Handling error reports

After every report `waitForReady()` call, check `result.error`. If it is present, read `references/error-reports.md` for the error-report workflow.

## What this skill can do

1. **Authenticate to the tenant.** Read `references/setup-auth.md` for the interactive login flow.
2. **Discover runs from the runs page.** Read `references/run-discovery-ui.md`. Prefer `snouty runs list` whenever possible — only fall back to the UI when the API is unavailable or doesn't expose what you need.
3. **Read properties from a triage report.** Read `references/properties-from-ui.md`. Prefer `snouty runs --json properties` whenever possible.
4. **Look up a `run_id` from a triage-report URL** that cannot be matched against `snouty runs list`. The `run_id` is rendered at the bottom of the main report page (`report_id → run_id` is not currently exposed by the API).
5. **Download an error log from a failed run's report page.** See `references/error-reports.md`.
6. **Read a causality report.** Ask the user for the causality report URL. The main signal is the bug-probability trajectory in the logs leading up to the bug moment.
