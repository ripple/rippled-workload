# Property Discovery

## Goal

Systematically discover testable properties by examining the system from multiple
independent perspectives. Each perspective (attention focus) looks at the same
codebase but prioritizes different failure modes, producing properties that a
single unstructured pass would miss.

This process runs after the SUT analysis is complete and produces candidate
properties in the standard catalog format defined in `references/property-catalog.md`.

## Prerequisites

- `antithesis/scratchbook/sut-analysis.md` exists and is current
- `antithesis/scratchbook/existing-assertions.md` exists (scan results — may
  indicate no existing instrumentation, but must be present before agents are
  spawned)

## Attention Focuses

Each focus defines a lens for examining the system. Every focus should produce
properties in the standard catalog format.

### 1. Data Integrity

Consistency guarantees, invariants on stored state, corruption paths. Look for:
write ordering assumptions, transaction boundaries, constraint enforcement, data
loss scenarios under concurrent access.

### 2. Concurrency

Races, atomicity, ordering dependencies, shared mutable state. Look for: lock
ordering, TOCTOU patterns, concurrent container access, thread-safety assumptions
in documentation vs. implementation.

### 3. Failure Recovery

Crash recovery, restart correctness, partial failure handling, retry semantics.
Look for: incomplete operations that survive restarts, recovery procedures that
assume clean state, retry storms, idempotency gaps in recovery paths.
Also note candidate SUT instrumentation points for retry outcomes, recovery
subphases, and dangerous internal fallback paths that workloads may not observe
cleanly.

### 4. Protocol Contracts

API guarantees, message ordering, schema validation, backward compatibility. Look
for: documented API guarantees that aren't enforced, ordering assumptions between
services, response codes that mask errors.

### 5. Resource Boundaries

Exhaustion, leaks, backpressure, capacity limits, queue depths. Look for:
unbounded queues, missing backpressure, file descriptor leaks, memory growth under
sustained load, connection pool exhaustion.

### 6. Security Boundaries

Authentication/authorization invariants, privilege escalation paths, input
validation. Look for: operations that bypass auth checks, role escalation through
sequences of valid operations, injection points.

### 7. Distributed Coordination

Consensus, leader election, split-brain, network partition behavior, replication.
Look for: split-brain recovery, replication lag visibility, quorum loss handling,
stale leader commands. May yield no properties for single-process systems.
Also note candidate SUT instrumentation points for redirect emission, leader
handoff, stepdown, and leadership-loss retry internals.

### 8. Lifecycle Transitions

Startup, shutdown, upgrade, migration, initialization ordering. Look for: requests
during startup before subsystems are ready, graceful shutdown that drops in-flight
work, migration steps that assume no concurrent traffic.
Also note candidate SUT instrumentation points for distinct lifecycle outcomes,
not just broad "entered startup/shutdown path" markers.

### 9. Idempotency and Replay

Duplicate handling, at-least-once delivery, reprocessing safety. Look for: side
effects on retry, message deduplication gaps, replay of already-applied operations.

### 10. Version Compatibility

Behavioral differences across client/server version combinations, backward/forward
compatibility guarantees, deprecation boundary correctness. Look for: changed
serialization formats, removed/renamed fields, different default values across
versions, protocol negotiation failures.

### 11. Wildcard

The other 10 focuses have fixed lenses — they see what their descriptions tell
them to look for. This focus has no fixed lens. Its job is to find what they will
all miss: the weird, the novel, the property that doesn't fit any category but
matters anyway. These are not principles — this focus is deliberately unconstrained.

1. **Know the covered territory.** The orchestrator provides a one-line summary of
   each other focus. Understand their territory. Your job starts where theirs ends.

2. **Look for the non-obvious.** Properties that emerge from behaviors nobody would
   think to check. The system works, the standard invariants hold, but something
   about the interaction pattern is surprising. Trust that instinct and turn it into
   a testable property.

3. **Find missing concepts.** Not missing data integrity checks (Focus 1 handles
   that) or missing concurrency properties (Focus 2 handles that) — but missing
   *angles*. A failure scenario nobody considers. A guarantee the system implicitly
   provides but never claims. A property that only matters under a specific
   combination of conditions that no single focus would construct.

4. **Cross-cut.** Properties that live at the intersection of multiple focus areas.
   Where failure recovery interacts with idempotency in ways neither focus captures
   alone. Where resource exhaustion triggers a protocol violation. Where a lifecycle
   transition exposes a concurrency bug that only manifests during version upgrades.

5. **Question the frame.** The other focuses look for properties within their
   domains. You can question whether the domains are complete. Is there an entire
   class of failure that the focus set doesn't cover? Is there a property the system
   *should* have but nobody would think to assert because it seems too obvious?

6. **Report what's odd.** If a code path feels like it would produce an interesting
   property but you can't fully specify the invariant, describe the intuition. A
   vague signal from the wildcard is still signal.

## Ensemble Mode

If your environment supports spawning sub-agents, run property discovery as an
ensemble — one agent per attention focus, in parallel.

### Agent Instructions

Spawn one agent per focus. Each agent receives:

- The contents of `antithesis/scratchbook/sut-analysis.md`
- The property catalog format from `references/property-catalog.md`
- One attention focus (its full description and "look for" guidance from above)
- The path to `antithesis/scratchbook/existing-assertions.md` — read this before
  writing evidence files; for each property, note which assertions already exist
  vs. which are missing
- The list of user-named external references with their `why` notes (from the scope question), so the agent can consult them as part of its analysis — treat each as a lead to validate, not a fact (see `references/validating-claims.md`)
- These instructions:

> Examine the codebase through the lens of your assigned attention focus. Produce
> properties in the standard catalog format. For each property, include your
> confidence (high/medium/low) and what evidence in the codebase supports it. If
> this focus yields no relevant properties for this system, say so and explain why.
> Before you build a property on a claim from an external source — an issue or a
> doc — validate it per `references/validating-claims.md`: a reported bug is a
> lead, not a fact, and must be confirmed a real system defect (not the reporter's
> environment or config) before it becomes a property.

**Wildcard agent:** The wildcard agent (Focus 11) runs in parallel with the others
but receives different context. Instead of a "look for" list, it receives:

- The contents of `antithesis/scratchbook/sut-analysis.md`
- The property catalog format from `references/property-catalog.md`
- The wildcard directives from its focus description above
- A one-line summary of each other focus, derived from the focus names and opening
  sentences above (e.g., "Focus 1: Data Integrity — consistency guarantees,
  invariants on stored state, corruption paths"). Do not include the detailed
  "Look for:" lists — the wildcard should know what territory is covered, not how
  the others search it.
- The path to `antithesis/scratchbook/existing-assertions.md`
- Access to the codebase
- The list of user-named external references with their `why` notes (from the scope question), so the agent can consult them as part of its analysis — treat each as a lead to validate, not a fact (see `references/validating-claims.md`)

### Agent Output

Each agent writes detailed evidence to disk and returns a compact summary.

**Written to disk:** For each property, write an evidence file to
`properties/{slug}.md` in the scratchbook, where `{slug}` is a descriptive
kebab-case name for the property. If a file already exists at the chosen name
(another agent got there first), pick a different slug. Capture the specific
code paths examined (files, functions, line numbers), the failure scenario, key
observations, and any open questions with context on why they matter and what the
answer would change. Write everything a future reader would need to understand
why this property was identified and how the code is involved. For each
property's SUT-side instrumentation suggestions, cross-reference
`existing-assertions.md` and explicitly note whether each suggested assertion
already exists in the codebase, is partially present, or is missing.

**Returned to synthesis:**

- Properties in catalog format (may be empty). Populate the Open Questions list
  directly from the questions written into the evidence file, following
  `references/property-catalog.md` ("Open Questions Conventions"). At this
  stage, questions are typically untagged — they haven't been investigated
  yet. The synthesis "Investigate Open Questions" step adds tags.
- If a question you raised would contradict a prose claim you'd otherwise
  write in **Property**, **Invariant**, **Antithesis Angle**, or **Why It
  Matters**, write the prose at the level of generality the analysis
  supports — don't overcommit to an answer the Open Questions list says is
  uncertain. The list does the work of surfacing uncertainty; the prose
  doesn't need parenthetical hedges. See `references/property-catalog.md`
  ("Honest Summaries").
- For each property, the evidence file slug and a brief rationale summary —
  enough for synthesis to deduplicate, resolve conflicts, and evaluate assertion
  type, but not the full evidence narrative
- A brief note on what areas of the codebase it examined beyond specific properties
- Assumptions made that affect multiple properties

### Synthesis

After all agents complete, synthesize into a single property catalog:

- **Deduplicate:** Multiple agents finding the same property is a confidence
  signal. Merge duplicates, noting which focuses identified them.
- **Preserve unique finds:** Properties found by only one focus are the primary
  value of the ensemble — don't drop them without cause.
- **Resolve conflicts:** When agents disagree on assertion type or priority for
  the same property, evaluate which reasoning is stronger. Note the disagreement
  and resolution in the property's rationale.
- **Assign slugs and organize:** Each agent already assigned a slug and wrote
  an evidence file. For unique properties, accept the agent's slug. For merged
  properties, pick the best slug from the contributing agents. If the canonical
  slug differs from an agent's file, rename the evidence file to match. Group
  properties into categories per the catalog format. The slug is the canonical
  ID — see `references/property-catalog.md` for details.
- **Record provenance:** For each property, note which focus(es) surfaced it.
- **Merge duplicate evidence:** For properties found by multiple agents, read
  the relevant evidence files and combine them into a single coherent file under
  the canonical slug. Delete the extra evidence files. Unique properties already
  have their final evidence file on disk — don't read them into context.
- **Write property relationships:** Review the complete property set and write
  `property-relationships.md` in the scratchbook. Group properties that share
  evidence, code paths, or failure mechanisms into clusters. Note any suspected
  dominance (where one property likely implies another). This is lightweight —
  flag connections you noticed during synthesis, don't do deep analysis.
- **Apply provenance frontmatter:** Write `sut_path`, current `commit`, today's `updated`, and the list of `external_references` (from the user's scope answer) to `property-catalog.md` and `property-relationships.md` per `references/scratchbook-setup.md`.
- **Investigate open questions:** see "Investigate Open Questions" below.

#### Investigate Open Questions

For each property that has open questions in its evidence file, spawn an agent to investigate. Run these in parallel — one agent per property with open questions.

Each agent receives the path to the evidence file, codebase access, the path to `antithesis/scratchbook/existing-assertions.md`, and `references/validating-claims.md`.

Each agent must:

- Read the evidence file's explanation of why each question matters and investigate the code to answer it. If a question asks whether a reported defect is real, confirm it per `references/validating-claims.md` — cite discriminating primary evidence, not the report's description.
- Not fabricate answers. If a question can't be resolved from code, docs, or other available evidence, leave it open with partial findings noted. Tag `(partial: ...)` when there are partial findings; tag `(needs human input)` only after exhausting investigation against code and docs. Some questions legitimately need human input — that is a normal outcome, not a failure of the step.
- Record an investigation log in the evidence file under an `### Investigation Log` heading (see `references/property-catalog.md` "Investigation Log") so the "attempted" check in `SKILL.md` self-review is auditable.
- Update the evidence file: remove resolved questions, note partial findings, apply human-input tags. Correct any instrumentation suggestions against `existing-assertions.md` to reflect what already exists vs. what is missing.

Each agent returns a short structured summary (not the full evidence file) describing: which questions were resolved, which remain (and in what state), whether the property changed (different invariant, different assertion type), and whether the property was invalidated with the reason.

After all agents return, review the summaries. Update the catalog whenever a property is invalidated, changed, or has remaining unresolved questions — sync the Open Questions list under each affected property from the evidence file, following `references/property-catalog.md` ("Open Questions Conventions"). If a resolution makes a parametric term in the prose more specific, refine the prose field accordingly. Re-evaluate property relationships if any property changed or was invalidated.

## Single-Agent Mode

If your environment does not support sub-agents, work through the attention
focuses as a sequential checklist:

1. Read the SUT analysis.
2. Read `antithesis/scratchbook/existing-assertions.md` so you have the full
   picture of what's already instrumented before writing any evidence files.
3. For each attention focus 1–10 in order, make an explicit pass through the
   codebase with that lens. Treat any claim from an external source (an issue or
   doc) as a lead to validate, not a fact — confirm a reported bug is a real
   defect per `references/validating-claims.md` before building a property on it.
   After each pass, add new properties to a running catalog. If a focus yields
   nothing for this system, note why and move on.
4. Run the wildcard pass (Focus 11) last. Unlike the other passes, the wildcard is
   not a fresh examination — it deliberately builds on awareness of what the
   previous passes covered, looking for properties they missed.
5. After all 11 passes, review the full catalog for duplicates, gaps, and
   consistency.
6. Assign a descriptive kebab-case slug to each property and organize into final
   form per the catalog format.
7. Apply provenance frontmatter to `property-catalog.md` per `references/scratchbook-setup.md`.
8. For each property, write an evidence file to `properties/{slug}.md` in the
   scratchbook. Capture the supporting evidence, relevant code paths, failure
   scenario, and key observations you encountered during your passes. For each
   property's SUT-side instrumentation suggestions, cross-reference
   `existing-assertions.md` and explicitly note whether each suggested assertion
   already exists in the codebase, is partially present, or is missing.
9. Review the complete property set and write `property-relationships.md` in the
   scratchbook. Group properties that share evidence, code paths, or failure
   mechanisms into clusters. Note any suspected dominance relationships. This is
   lightweight — flag connections you noticed during the passes, don't do deep
   analysis. Apply provenance frontmatter per `references/scratchbook-setup.md`.
10. For each property with open questions in its evidence file, investigate the
    code to answer them:

    - Read the evidence file's explanation of why each question matters and
      trace the code to answer it. If a question asks whether a reported defect
      is real, confirm it per `references/validating-claims.md` — cite
      discriminating primary evidence, not the report's description.
    - Don't fabricate answers. Tag `(partial: ...)` when partial findings exist;
      tag `(needs human input)` only after exhausting investigation against code
      and docs.
    - Record an investigation log in the evidence file under an `### Investigation Log` heading (see `references/property-catalog.md` "Investigation Log") so
      the "attempted" check in `SKILL.md` self-review is auditable.
    - Update the evidence file with resolved answers and their implications,
      including correcting any instrumentation suggestions against
      `existing-assertions.md`.
    - Sync the Open Questions list under each property from the evidence file,
      following `references/property-catalog.md` ("Open Questions Conventions").
      If a resolution makes a parametric term in the prose more specific,
      refine the prose field accordingly.
    - If an answer changes the property or invalidates it, update accordingly.
      Mark invalidated properties in the catalog with the reason.

Treat each focus pass (Focuses 1–10) as a fresh examination. Resist the pull to
skip a focus because earlier passes "already covered" that area — the point is
to look at the same code from different angles. The wildcard pass is the
exception — it runs last and uses knowledge of the covered territory to find
gaps.

## Output

- `antithesis/scratchbook/property-catalog.md` — using the format defined in
  `references/property-catalog.md`, including provenance frontmatter per
  `references/scratchbook-setup.md`
- `antithesis/scratchbook/properties/{slug}.md` — one per cataloged property
- `antithesis/scratchbook/property-relationships.md` — suspected clusters and
  connections, including provenance frontmatter per `references/scratchbook-setup.md`
